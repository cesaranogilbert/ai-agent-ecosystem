## 📊 Usage Examples

### MCP Integration
```python
# Connect agent to enterprise tools
await connect_agent_to_tools("client_acquisition_specialist", ["slack_messenger", "salesforce_connector"])

# Execute tool on behalf of agent
result = await execute_agent_tool("high_ticket_closer", "salesforce_connector", {
    "action": "create_opportunity", 
    "amount": 150000,
    "stage": "qualification"
})
```

### Visual Workflows
```python
# Create workflow from template
workflow_id = visual_workflow_service.create_from_template("lead_to_close", "Enterprise Sales Pipeline")

# Execute workflow
result = await visual_workflow_service.execute_workflow(workflow_id, {"lead_source": "website"})
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
```python
# Create collaboration project
project_id = collaboration_service.create_collaboration_project(
    "Q4 Marketing Campaign", 
    "Comprehensive marketing campaign with AI agents",
    ["increase_leads", "improve_conversion", "reduce_costs"]
)

# Auto-assign tasks to agents
assignments = await collaboration_service.auto_assign_tasks(project_id)
```
